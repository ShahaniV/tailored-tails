PHPMyAdmin is primarily designed for managing databases and doesn't provide a direct way to upload images. However, you can store images in a database table by converting them into binary data and storing them in a BLOB (Binary Large Object) column. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

Create a table: First, create a table in your database to store the images. The table should have a BLOB column to hold the image data along with other necessary columns.

Prepare the image: Before uploading the image, you need to prepare it in PHP. Read the image file using functions like file_get_contents() or fread() to retrieve its binary data.

Convert image to binary: Convert the image data into binary format using functions like base64_encode() or pack(). This step is necessary to store the image as a BLOB in the database.

Execute an SQL query: Use an SQL INSERT query to insert the image data into the BLOB column of the table. Construct the query using PHP and bind the binary image data as a parameter.

Execute the PHP code: Run the PHP code that contains the image preparation, conversion, and SQL query execution.

Note: Storing images directly in the database can have some drawbacks, such as increased database size and potential performance issues. Consider alternative approaches, such as storing the images on the server's file system and storing the file paths in the database instead.
